1. The javelin
==============
- idea of a clear differentiation between the facts and the conventions
---- in a sense, no one is contesting "what happened"; all of the available evidence agrees
---- quote from Antiphon tetralogy about the facts being clear

- so then the question — and not a trivial question at all, it seems — is how to *call*/describe those facts
---- or the "character" of the facts, if we want to phrase it in such a way that gives it more weight
---- Cicero's definitional issues

- question of who is responsible for the accident, or "caused" it
---- Protagoras/Bonazzi/St. John on it being different from different perspectives

- how do courts typically deal with such questions? seems like through the concept of "proximate cause"
---- common in injury law, determining liability
---- historically traced by Nicholas St. John
---- St. John's argument that there's nothing concrete in this idea
---- really everything just hinges on its relevance to the question of *responsibility*: what duties did each person have, which they fulfilled or didn't?
------- "who caused it" is already a very different question from "what caused it"
---- and whoever said just one party had to be culpable

2. The squirrel and the sun [note: restructure this to reflect that the sun and the squirrel examples are more equivalent than I originally thought]
===========================
- here again you *seem* to get a situation where there's a difference between the facts and how you talk about the facts
- the difference is just that the facts and how you talk about them don't appear as separate things here, but as intertwined.
---- in the squirrel case you might untangle them, as James does; 
------- for him this is a pointless debate:  everyone *knows* in some sense what's happening, it's just depends on how you interpret a word
------- "around" in this case turns out to be irredeemably relative, but you can isolate the problem to a single word, and get around it by describing it with different words
---- in the sun case, it's hard to untangle it; there seems to be something relative about the concept of motion
------- Goodman challenges you to describe the facts apart from any frames of reference

3. This arbitrariness is an endemic quality of facts
====================================================
- provide non-motion examples of cases where different frames of reference provide different facts
---- phrases from the facts in the javelin case e.g."death" in different contexts
- some responses to these examples, and my replies to those responses
---- the Cavellian "what did I ever mean by..." response
------- [this is where I want to make a broader challenge about how facts work]
---- the challenge that this isn't as endemic as you say
------- granted with some words/concepts, it's harder to generate examples that confuse our understanding of what they are
---- the assertion that there's something 'underneath' all the words, something we don't have control over and stays the same however we decide to phrase it
------- on a basic level I don't disagree; [separate objectivity here from correspondence theory of language]
------- what we want is to be able to say something will behave the way it does regardless of how we describe it
---------- all we need, in order to acknowledge that, is to say that facts are validated in reference to the world
------------- in the javelin case, witnesses, fingerprints, etc show a fact's efficacy based on how we interpret it





4. Some conclusions drawn from 3
=================================
- Ruskin: "I know you feel as if I were trying to take away the honour of your churches. Not so; I am trying to prove to you the honour of your houses and your hills; not that the Church is not sacred — but that the whole Earth IS"
- the only way facts can conflict is in our making use of them; the things we can find out, and the actions we can take successfully on the basis of knowing a fact are its validation
- you can know a thing without being able to articulate it directly
---- riding a bike, the meaning of a word
